'''
Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:
x is greater than or equal to -10. x has already been defined.
"test" is less than or equal to y. y has already been defined.
True is greater than False.
'''

# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6
print(x >= -10)


# Comparison of strings
y = "test"
print("test" <= y)

# Comparison of booleans
print(True > False)
