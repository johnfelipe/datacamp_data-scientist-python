Create the variable offset with an initial value of 8.
Code a while loop that keeps running as long as offset is not equal to 0.
Inside the while loop: Print out the sentence "correcting...".
Next, decrease the value of offset by 1. You can do this with offset = offset - 1.
Finally, print out offset so you can see how it changes.

# Initialize offset
offset = 8

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    offset = offset-1
    print(offset)
