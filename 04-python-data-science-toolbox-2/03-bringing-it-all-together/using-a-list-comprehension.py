'''
Inspect the contents of row_lists by printing the first two lists in row_lists. Create a list comprehension that generates a dictionary using lists2dict() for each sublist in row_lists. The keys are from the feature_names list and the values are the row entries in row_lists. Use sublist as your iterator variable and assign the resulting list of dictionaries to list_of_dicts. Look at the first two dictionaries in list_of_dicts by printing them out.
