 Extract the column 'created_at' from df and assign the result to tweet_time. Fun fact: the extracted column in tweet_time here is a Series data structure! Create a list comprehension that extracts the time from each row in tweet_time. Each row is a string that represents a timestamp, and you will access the 12th to 19th characters in the string to extract the time. Use entry as the iterator variable and assign the result to tweet_clock_time. Remember that Python uses 0-based indexing!

# Extract the created_at column from df: tweet_time
tweet_time = pd.read_csv('tweets.csv')['created_at']

# Extract the clock time: tweet_clock_time
tweet_clock_time = [entry[11:19] for entry in tweet_time]

# Print the extracted times
print(tweet_clock_time)
