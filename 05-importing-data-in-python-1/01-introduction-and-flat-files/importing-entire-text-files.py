Open the file moby_dick.txt as read-only and store it in the variable file. Make sure to pass the filename enclosed in quotation marks ''. Print the contents of the file to the shell using the print() function. As Hugo showed in the video, you'll need to apply the method read() to the object file. Check whether the file is closed by executing print(file.closed). Close the file using the close() method. Check again that the file is closed as you did above.
