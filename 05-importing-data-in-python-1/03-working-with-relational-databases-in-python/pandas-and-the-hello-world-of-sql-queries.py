'''
Import the pandas package using the alias pd. Using the function create_engine(), create an engine for the SQLite database Chinook.sqlite and assign it to the variable engine. Use the pandas function read_sql_query() to assign to the variable df the DataFrame of results from the following query: select all records from the table Album. Run the rest of the code to confirm that the DataFrame created by this method is equal to that created by the previous method that you learned.
