'''
Using the function create_engine(), create an engine for the SQLite database Chinook.sqlite and assign it to the variable engine. In the context manager, execute the query that selects all records from the Employee table and orders them in increasing order by the column BirthDate. Assign the result to rs. In a call to pd.DataFrame(), apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df. Set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
