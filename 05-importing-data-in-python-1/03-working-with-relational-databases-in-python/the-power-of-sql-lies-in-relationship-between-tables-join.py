Assign to rs the results from the following query: select all the records, extracting the Title of the record and Name of the artist of each record from the Album table and the Artist table, respectively. To do so, INNER JOIN these two tables on the ArtistID column of both. In a call to pd.DataFrame(), apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df. Set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
