'''
Import the pickle package. Complete the second argument of open() so that it is read only for a binary file. This argument will be a string of two letters, one signifying 'read only', the other 'binary'. Pass the correct argument to pickle.load(); it should use the variable that is bound to open. Print the data, d. Print the datatype of d; take your mind back to your previous use of the function type().
