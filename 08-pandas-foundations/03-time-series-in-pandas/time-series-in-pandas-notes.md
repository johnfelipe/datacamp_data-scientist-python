# Creating and using a DatetimeIndex
The pandas Index is a powerful way to handle time series data, so it is valuable to know how to build one yourself. Pandas provides the pd.to_datetime() function for just this task. For example, if passed the list of strings ['2015-01-01 091234','2015-01-01 091234'] and a format specification variable, such as format='%Y-%m-%d %H%M%S, pandas will parse the string into the proper datetime elements and build the datetime objects.

In this exercise, a list of temperature data and a list of date strings has been pre-loaded for you as temperature_list and date_list respectively. Your job is to use the .to_datetime() method to build a DatetimeIndex out of the list of date strings, and to then use it along with the list of temperature data to build a pandas Series.

Requirement(s)
Prepare a format string, time_format, using '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' as the desired format.
Convert date_list into a datetime object by using the pd.to_datetime() function. Specify the format string you defined above and assign the result to my_datetimes.
Construct a pandas Series called time_series using pd.Series() with temperature_list and my_datetimes. Set the index of the Series to be my_datetimes.
```
# Prepare a format string: time_format
time_format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'

# Convert date_list into a datetime object: my_datetimes
my_datetimes = pd.to_datetime(date_list, format=time_format)  

# Construct a pandas Series using temperature_list and my_datetimes: time_series
time_series = pd.Series(temperature_list, index=my_datetimes)
```

# Reindexing the Index
Reindexing is useful in preparation for adding or otherwise combining two time series data sets. To reindex the data, we provide a new index and ask pandas to try and match the old data to the new index. If data is unavailable for one of the new index dates or times, you must tell pandas how to fill it in. Otherwise, pandas will fill with NaN by default.

In this exercise, two time series data sets containing daily data have been pre-loaded for you, each indexed by dates. The first, ts1, includes weekends, but the second, ts2, does not. The goal is to combine the two data sets in a sensible way. Your job is to reindex the second data set so that it has weekends as well, and then add it to the first. When you are done, it would be informative to inspect your results.

Requirement(s)
Create a new time series ts3 by reindexing ts2 with the index of ts1. To do this, call .reindex() on ts2 and pass in the index of ts1 (ts1.index).
Create another new time series, ts4, by calling the same .reindex() as above, but also specifiying a fill method, using the keyword argument method="ffill" to forward-fill values.
Add ts1 + ts2. Assign the result to sum12.
Add ts1 + ts3. Assign the result to sum13.
Add ts1 + ts4, Assign the result to sum14.
```
# Reindex without fill method: ts3
ts3 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index)

# Reindex with fill method, using forward fill: ts4
ts4 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index, method='ffill')

# Combine ts1 + ts2: sum12
sum12 = ts1 + ts2

# Combine ts1 + ts3: sum13
sum13 = ts1 + ts3

# Combine ts1 + ts4: sum14
sum14 = ts1 + ts4
```

# Resampling and frequency
Pandas provides methods for resampling time series data. When downsampling or upsampling, the syntax is similar, but the methods called are different. Both use the concept of 'method chaining' - df.method1().method2().method3() - to direct the output from one method call to the input of the next, and so on, as a sequence of operations, one feeding into the next.

For example, if you have hourly data, and just need daily data, pandas will not guess how to throw out the 23 of 24 points. You must specify this in the method. One approach, for instance, could be to take the mean, as in df.resample('D').mean().

In this exercise, a data set containing hourly temperature data has been pre-loaded for you. Your job is to resample the data using a variety of aggregation methods to answer a few questions.

Requirement(s)
Downsample the 'Temperature' column of df to 6 hour data using .resample('6h') and .mean(). Assign the result to df1.
Downsample the 'Temperature' column of df to daily data using .resample('D') and then count the number of data points in each day with .count(). Assign the result df2.
